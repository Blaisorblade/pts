## Description

A Haskell implementation of the [Pure Type
System](http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/pure+type+system)

##Installation

Run the following commands at the top:

```
cabal install

To proactively avoid dependency hell, consider using
[cabal-dev](https://github.com/creswick/cabal-dev) or some other
tool to sandbox builds.
